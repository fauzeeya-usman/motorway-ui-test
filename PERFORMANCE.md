### 2. Performance

The API that is returning images is rather slow. Show how it can be sped up, and show how you would measure the improvement in performance.

To speed up the API and measure the improvement in performance, I considered implementing the following steps:

Implement Caching: Cache the API response for a certain duration to avoid making repetitive requests to the slow API. Uinsg tools like Redis or Memcached to store the cached data and serve it directly from the cache instead of hitting the API every time.

Optimize Image Delivery: Resize and compress the images on the server-side before sending them as a response. This reduces the file size and improves the loading time of the images on the client-side.

Minimize Network Requests: Combine multiple API requests into a single request or use batch processing techniques to reduce the number of network round trips.

Implement Content Delivery Network (CDN): Utilize a CDN to deliver the images to users from the nearest edge server, reducing latency and improving overall performance.

To measure the improvement in performance, you can track metrics such as response time, server load, and network latency before and after implementing these optimizations. Tools like Google Chrome DevTools or browser extensions like Lighthouse can provide detailed insights into the performance of your web application.

// 1. Implement Caching
const cache = {}; // In-memory cache for storing API responses

app.get('/images', (req, res) => {
const { limit } = req.query;
if (cache[limit]) {
// Serve cached response if available
return res.json(cache[limit]);
}

// Otherwise, fetch data from the slow API
fetchSlowApi(limit)
.then(data => {
// Store the response in cache
cache[limit] = data;
res.json(data);
})
.catch(error => {
res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to fetch data' });
});
});

// 2. Optimize Image Delivery
app.get('/optimized-images/:imageName', (req, res) => {
const imageName = req.params.imageName;
const imagePath = `path/to/images/${imageName}`;

// Apply image optimization techniques here (resize, compress, etc.)

// Serve the optimized image
res.sendFile(imagePath);
});

// 3. Minimize Network Requests
app.get('/combined-data', (req, res) => {
Promise.all([fetchData1(), fetchData2(), fetchData3()])
.then(([data1, data2, data3]) => {
const combinedData = { data1, data2, data3 };
res.json(combinedData);
})
.catch(error => {
res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to fetch data' });
});
});

// 4. Implement Content Delivery Network (CDN)
app.use('/images', express.static('public/images'));
